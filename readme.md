# 🏠 IoT Smart Home – CN Project

This is a conceptual **Computer Networks project** that demonstrates a smart home system using IoT devices, wireless communication, and centralized control via a server and router. The setup was designed using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 📡 Network Topology

The smart home includes various connected devices that communicate via a **wireless router** and are monitored or controlled through a **central server** and a **laptop client**.

## 🔧 Devices Used

- **Server**: Central controller for managing devices and data
- **Laptop**: Acts as a client to access and configure the network
- **Switch + Router**: Connect wired and wireless devices
- **IoT Devices**:
  - Temperature Monitor
  - Webcam
  - Motion Detector
  - Light
  - Air Conditioner
  - Fan
  - Garage Door
  - Window
  - Door

## 🌐 Communication

- IoT devices connect wirelessly to the router (WRT300N)
- The server and laptop are connected through a wired switch
- Communication protocols like HTTP or MQTT can be assumed for data transfer

## 💡 Concept Highlights

- Real-time sensor data monitoring (temperature, motion)
- Remote control of appliances (fan, light, AC, doors)
- Integration of physical and virtual devices
- Layered architecture: Access, Distribution, and Core layers
